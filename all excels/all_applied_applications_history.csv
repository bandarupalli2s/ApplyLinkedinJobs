What You'll Be Doing:

Architect and manage secure, scalable infrastructure on AWS using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation
Design and maintain CI/CD pipelines to support rapid, safe deployments
Integrate E2E testing workflows to improve system reliability across environments
Monitor and optimize performance using tools like Datadog, Prometheus, or similar
Collaborate with developers to improve platform resilience, observability, and developer experience
Automate operational processes to eliminate toil and improve scalability
Occasionally contribute to internal tooling using TypeScript/Node.js
Design and support fault-tolerant systems, including backup and recovery strategies
Foster a strong DevOps culture grounded in automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement

What They're Looking For:
5+ years in DevOps, Platform, or Cloud Engineering roles
Strong hands-on experience with AWS (EKS/ECS, RDS, EC2, Lambda)
Infrastructure as Code proficiency (Terraform preferred)
Deep understanding of CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
Knowledge of monitoring/logging platforms (e.g., Datadog)
Familiarity with containerization & orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
Strong scripting/automation skills (Python, Bash, or similar)
Solid grasp of secure and scalable infrastructure design principles
Excellent cross-functional communication and documentation skills

Nice-to-Have (Not Required):
Experience with Web3 infrastructure (Ethereum nodes, oracles, IPFS, validators)
Exposure to blockchain APIs (Web3, Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
Familiarity with real-time streaming tools (e.g., Kafka)
Background in financial or payments architecture
GitOps tools knowledge (ArgoCD, Flux)
Interest in TypeScript/Node.js development
Passion for working in fast-moving, high-autonomy startup environments

Why This Role Stands Out:
Play a core role in scaling the technical foundation of a breakout Web3 product
Work at the intersection of infrastructure, crypto, and payments
Join a highly technical, execution-focused team where ownership and autonomy are the norm
Build systems that are invisible when they work—and resilient when they don’t
Be part of a company redefining how digital assets are used in everyday transactions

If you’re passionate about DevOps and intrigued by the idea of shaping the infrastructure behind the next generation of Web3 payments, we’d love to tell you more.
